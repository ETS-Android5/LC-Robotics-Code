/**
 * The location where all LCR code will be placed.
 *
 * If you're just learning, here are some tips for basic program creation.
 *
 * In Android Studio:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Open the package {@link org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller.external.samples}.</li>
 *     <li>In that package, there are a bunch of sample classes that showcase different things you can code.
 *     Find one that suits your needs, and copy everything in the file.</li>
 *     <li>Rightclick (or two-finger click) on the folder "org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode"</li>
 *     <li>New -&rt; Java Class</li>
 *     <li>Type whatever name you want to call your code, and click OK.</li>
 *     <li>Delete everything, and paste the sample into your file.</li>
 *     <li>Replace line 1 with this: <pre><code>package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode;</code></pre></li>
 *     <li>Change the name after the word <code>class</code> to the name you chose. (Capitalization matters!)</li>
 *     <li>Save your work!</li>
 *     <li>Take a look at the code. FTC does a good job of commenting, so see if you can get a general understanding of what's going on.</li>
 *     <li>Once you feel like you have a good idea of how to use this code, tweak it to your own needs.
 *     (Change the numbers, add more movements, etc.) If you still aren't sure, come talk to Noah or Gabe.</li>
 *     <li>Save your work!</li>
 *     <li>From the top menu: VCS -&rt; Git -&rt; Add</li>
 *     <li>VCS -&rt; Commit. In Commit Message, summarize what your code does.</li>
 *     <li>Click the arrow next to the Commit button, and click Commit and Push.</li>
 *     <li>Push, and you're done!</li>
 * </ol>
 *
